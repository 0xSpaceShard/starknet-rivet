# What is Starknet Rivet?

Rivet is a developer-focused wallet & DevTools for Starknet - a browser extension that enables developers to inspect, debug, modify, and manipulate the state of a local Starknet node. Centered around common workflows of frontend Starknet development, it is compatible with any Starknet DApp, and comes with many advanced features out-of-the-box. We are excited for the community to build Rivet with us, so feel free to reach out if youâ€™re interested in contributing!

Rivet is a browser extension that allows users to connect to any Starknet app and has all the table-stakes features one would expect in a wallet, i.e. manage multiple addresses, sign and submit transactions or messages, and view your transaction history.
